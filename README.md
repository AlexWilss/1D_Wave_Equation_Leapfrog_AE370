# 1D_Wave_Equation_Leapfrog_AE370
Numerical simulation of the leapfrog method similar to the forward euler method used to simulate wave oscillations with and without damping

## Project Overview
This project numerically solves the 1D wave equation to study the dynamics of an oscillating wave under varied levels of damping. We investigate wave oscillation, and the effects of various physical parameters on wave dynamics.

## Research Objectives
1. **Conservation of Energy**: Observe wave behavior under the absence of damping.
2. **Steel String Analysis**: Analyze the oscillation behavior of a steel string with a damping coefficient of 1.
3. **Nylon String Analysis**: Analyze the oscillation behavior of a nylon string with a damping coefficient of 10.

## Numerical Methods
Tested the method of lines numerical methods for an initial-boundary value problem:

Confirmed the numerical method through convergence analysis
